# Good-Programming-Practices

## Principles of Software Development

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) vs WET (We Edit Terribly, We Enjoy Typing...)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
  > acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

  - S: [Single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
    > a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. changes to only one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)
  - O: [Open/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)
    > “software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
  - L: [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
    > “objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.
  - I: [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
    > “many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”[8]
  - D: [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
    > one should “depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions"

## To be classified

  - Great naming convention by Angel Costela:  __Given__\_state\_a\___When__\_b\_happens\___Then__\_return\_{true|false|...}
